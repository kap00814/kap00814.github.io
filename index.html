    <p>This webpage explores the T-rex, the Stegasaurus, and the Pterodactyl, the three most recognizable dinosaurs!</p>

    <p> <br> </p>
    <p><B>The T-Rex</B> the King of Dinosaurs, the Tyrannosaurus Rex was discovered in 1905 by Henry Osbum. It is believed that the T-Rex roamed the earth over 60 million years ago! </p>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Stegosaurus_BW.jpg" alt="stegpic" align=left height=60>
    <p><b>The Stegosaurus</b> With over 10 bone plates on their backs, the Stegosaurus is one of the most easily identified dinosaurs. Discovered in 1855 by Otheniel Charles Marsh, the stegosaurus was one of the first specimens to inspire archiology! It is believed that they roamed the earth 150 million years ago! </p>
    <img src="https://swingingthecactus.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/pterodactyl.jpg" align=left height=60 alt="pteropic">
    <p><b>The Pterodactyl</b> The obvious ancestor of our flying friends! When Pterodactyl remains were discovered in 1784, it was originally believed to be remains of a large pelican, however after extensive research, it was discovered that the bones were millions of years old! 145 million, in fact!</p>

        <h3>Dino Rankings (according to my 2nd grade friends)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>T-Rex <b>"Because they're bigger than my car"- Billy</b></li>
            <li>Pterodactyl <b>"Because they can fly! I want to ride one!" - Emily</b></li>
            <li>Stegosaurus <b>"Because they are grumpy" -Allison</b></li>
        </ol>
        <p> <small>I am a student teacher at Clarke County Elementary, we are learning about computer coding and dinosaurs, I gave my class a survey on these three dinos, thus the source of my rankings is a class of children! I will also be showing this webpage to my class, as an example of coding, pretty cool!</small></p>
